  <h1><span class="villageName"></span></h1>
  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p><span class="villageName"></span> is a proof-of-concept <em>democratic monetary system</em>. It is a currency in which monetary policy is decided democratically by the users on a one person; one vote basis</p>

  <p>Unlike most currencies, <span class="villageName"></span> implements a one person; one account policy, which means that each citizen can have at most one VillageCoin bank account. This allows some interesting features of VillageCoin including:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Democracy</li>
      <li>Basic Income</li>
      <li>Automatic taxation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Access to the <span class="villageName"></span> economy is controlled by the <span class="villageName"></span> GateKeeper Committee. It is their job to enforce the one person; one account policy</p>

  <p>Account holders in <span class="villageName"></span> are called citizens. Citizens control and manage <span class="villageName"></span> through a democratic system of proposals and referendums, doing things like:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Creating money</li>
      <li>Setting tax policy</li>
      <li>Spending public funds</li>
      <li>Electing and dismissing gatekeepers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you would like to join the <span class="villageName"></span> economy why not <a href="#" id="linkClaimAccount">claim your account</a></p>
