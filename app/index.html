    <p>VillageCoin is a platform upon which you can create your own <em>Democratic Currency</em>. That's a phrase I made up to denote a currency in which monetary and fiscal policy are set democratically by the users on a one user; one vote basis.</p>
    <p>Unlike most currencies, VillageCoin currencies (aka <em>villages</em>) can implement arbitrary restrictions on account ownership (aka <em>citizenship</em>). This is primarily used to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">sybil attacks</a> by enforcing a one person; one account policy, but can also be used to restrict the currency to any subset of actors, for example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Humans</li>
        <li>Reddit users</li>
        <li>Freemasons</li>
    </ul> 

    <p>Each village has a trusted set of citizens called gatekeepers who are charged with implementing the <em>access policy</em> of the village, as specified by the citizens. The gatekeepers assess applications to join the village from aspiring citizens and may grant or deny access.</p>
    <p>The citizens of the village control everything else by a democratic system of referendums. They can do things like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create money</li>
        <li>Set tax policy</li>
        <li>Spend public funds</li>
        <li>Appoint and dismiss gatekeepers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm not sure what any of this is for, it's just something I made in my spare time, but it could be a way to experiment with monetary and fiscal policy in a safe sandbox</p>
    <p>If all that sounds like fun then why not join one of the <a href="villages.html">existing villages</a> or <a href="createVillage.html">create your own</a></p>
