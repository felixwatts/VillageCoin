VillageCoin is a toy currency and monetary system built on Ethereum. Unlike most currencies, it is _restricted use_, which means that a trusted group of humans called _gatekeepers_ control the creation of accounts. The gatekeepers can implement arbitrary conditions on account creation but are at least expected to prevent sybil accounts - leading to a one person; one account currency. This enables some interesting features including:

- Democratic control
- Automatic taxation
- [Universal Basic Income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income)

 Account holders in VillageCoin are called _citizens_. Citizens manage the currency democratically through a system of referendums. They can:

 - Set tax policy
 - Create money
 - Spend public funds
 - Appoint and dismiss gatekeepers

Anyone can create their own _village_, which is an instance of the currency with its own gatekeepers, citizens and policies.

I made VillageCoin in my spare time as a way to learn DApp development. Please don't take it too seriously or actually use it for anything serious!
