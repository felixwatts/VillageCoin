This is a toy currency and monetary system built on Ethereum

Unlike most currencies, it attempts to implement a one person; one account policy, which means that each account owner (aka citizen) can have at most one account. This allows some interesting features of including:

- Democratic control
- Basic income
- Automatic taxation

Account holders control and manage the currency through referendums, doing things like:</p>

- Creating money
- Setting tax policy
- Spending public funds

To prevent sybil attacks, account creation is controlled by a privileged user called the _gatekeeper_. In the current implementation the gatekeeper uses [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) to verify and validate applicants
